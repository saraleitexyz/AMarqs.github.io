# Personal Website for AMarqs

This is a redesigned and developed version of @AMarqs’s personal website, created by @saraleitexyz.

The goal was to create a clean, modern, and responsive site that reflects her personality and professional identity. This version replaces the previous one (still available in the `/old_web` folder) after a full visual and structural revamp.
